# MCArena
A kit PvP plugin for MCServer (Release 1.0)

A plugin for MCServer that adds arena-like functionality.
Currently in heavy development and beta state, this plugin is NOT recommended for non-dedicated use.
Player inventories are NOT saved between arena matches.  Take this into consideration before installing.

#CREATING AN ARENA
Use the golden pickaxe to edit your arenas.
  *Left Click = First position
  *Right Click = Second position
  *Shift+Click = Spectator teleport position

This is almost exactly the same as WorldEdit.
The defined cuboid will be the area of the arena.

Afterwards, do:
* /mca create {NAME}

The arena will automatically set itself up.

Use the following to join the arena
* /mca join {KIT NAME}

You must also be an Admin or have the mcarena.create permission to create these arenas.

Have fun.  :)

#NOW INCLUDES KITS
To make a new kit, edit kits.ini

Add a key entry.  This will become the kit name.

Under the key name, add item tags like:

* item1 = <some item>
* item2 = <another item>

Each item that you want to stack should have an amount specifier.  This is correct:

* item1 = 137
* amount1 = 16

This will give 16 Command Blocks to the player under that kit on entry.
